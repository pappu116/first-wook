                        <p>CpaRun is a Performance Marketing Agency or a CPA (cost per action) network that helps publishers and affiliates monetize their traffic by connecting them with merchant web sites and brands that share revenue and profit when a user completes an action. Affiliates can be crowd sourced into a single stream to achieve the highest commission tier, while advertisers have the opportunity to reach thousands of publishers by dealing with a single company and guaranteeing return on their advertising budget by only paying on successful user acquisition.</p>
                        <h2>Why should you partner with CpaRun?</h2>
                        <p>The affiliate network space is a red ocean of competitors and startups, where failures are more common than the successes and the experience. The majority of networks use a strategy of low salaries and high commissioned teams to insure their revenues and profits, taking both from affiliate and advertiser.</p>
                        <p>CpaRun's leaders are successful industry veterans and each one of them holds equity in our company. We've had personal relationships with a majority of our advertisers for more than a decade. We ensure their returns and work with them to develop new offers and brands from our experience. The top affiliates in our network are considered both partners and friends, and each new affiliate has an opportunity to be part of our philosophy of business. We have never missed a payment and we never will. This is more than a business to us, this is our lifestyle and our lifetime career.</p>
